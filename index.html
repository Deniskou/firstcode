  <p>I would like to take photogrpahs of you</p>
  <p>I started my life in a small French town, Villefranche de Rouergue. A place that I call a small country side town even if the meaning is a little bit paradoxical. A town of approximately 13000 inhabitants, if we count
  the commune. It was founded during the XIII century. You can imagine, how it was more charming and
  picturesque at this period. I was born there at the XX century, in 1978. At this date the town was already really
  less attractive. It’s at the number 15 of Félix avenue that I was bring up. One of the first workers plot of this town built
  in 1957. 57 identical houses, distributed in 7 parallel and perpendicular rows at the Félix avenue. The only variation is
  the fact that all these houses were stick on a symmetric way. From inside the house, I was easily able to imagine the
  neighbourhood like in a mirror of my own intimacy. The depth of the resonant coming from the wall let me at each
  moment supposing at which place, in which room my neighbour were. Everything, in my way of looking it was
  symmetrically identical. Several juxtaposed mirrors, parallels, perpendiculars, 57 exactly. The only pictures
  which were accessible for my sight, different than all this regular urbanisation was coming from the windows of my
  bedroom.
